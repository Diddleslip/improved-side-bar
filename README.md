# Improved-side-bar Solo Project
### Second project to improve and try out new ideas for a sidebar.

### Things learned:
* UL and LI tags are very nice to work with when it comes to making a Navbar component!
* CSS stylings are easy to decide when you have it already planned out for you, thanks to the UI design team.
* Link tags must be inside Router tags or else you will get an error

### Overall, a very satisfying solo project to improve upon exisiting Navbar built by me.

### Steps to recreate:

#### In console:
`
npm install react-router-dom
`
##### Add these lines to the App.js file:
`
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
`
##### Implement Navbar component code in the project.
